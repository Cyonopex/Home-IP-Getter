# Home-IP-Getter
Telegram bot that retrieves your home IP

The idea of this is to create a Telegram bot that will get my home IP and send it to myself as a Telegram message.

This is useful for people who have a Dynamic IP where their IP may change regularly. I wrote this so that I can have access to my home Raspberry Pi server and home network no matter where I am.

# Features
This bot has basic access control so that only certain Telegram user handles have access. If you do not want or need access control, just leave the user array blank.
