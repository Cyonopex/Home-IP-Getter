# Home-IP-Getter
Telegram bot that retrieves your home IP

The idea of this is to create a Telegram bot that will get my home IP and send it to myself as a Telegram message.

This is useful for people who have a Dynamic IP where their IP may change regularly. I wrote this so that I can have access to my home Raspberry Pi server and home network no matter where I am.
